# Shapes

Here we have the Box and Circle components that should help you define a region in your UI with background color, border curve, and elevation styles.

These components work by giving you a set of values that come from the theme to style your region, like background color that you can choose from the default and light backgrounds, and they will follow the light/dark theme colors

## Box example

This is how you can style a card

<Canvas>
  <Story id='components-shape-box--card' name='Card' />
</Canvas>

## Circle example

This is how you can style a icon with a custom background color

<Canvas>
  <Story id='components-shape-circle--circular-icon-shape' />
</Canvas>
