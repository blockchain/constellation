# Theme

Constellation provides light and dark themes out of the box.

To use change the theme the app is using, all you need to do is replace the theme object passed to the `ThemeProvider` component.

## Example

This example shows how you can use hooks to load the user preference from `localStorage` and select the correct theme.

```js
import { ThemeProvider, useThemeMode, useLocalStorage, ThemeMode } from '@blockchain/constellation'

const App = () => {
  const [themeMode] = useLocalStorage < ThemeMode > ('themeMode', 'light')

  const theme = useThemeMode(themeMode)

  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>children</ThemeProvider>
}
```

## Custom theme

You can extend an existing theme thanks to `extendTheme` utility to customize a theme. See the example below of how you can create a new custom theme where the primary text colour is green.

```
import { extendTheme } from 'theme'
import { lightTheme } from './theme.light'

export * from './theme.dark'
export * from './theme.light'

const customTheme = extendTheme(lightTheme, {
    text: {
        colors: {
            primary: "black"
        }
    }
})
```
